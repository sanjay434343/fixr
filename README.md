ðŸš€ Fixr â€” Your Trusted Partner for Home Services
Fixr is a powerful and reliable home service platform designed to make your life easier by connecting you with skilled and verified professionals. Whether you need an electrician, plumber, cleaner, carpenter, or any other home service, Fixr helps you book trusted experts instantly through a seamless and user-friendly experience. Using a smart Zone Level Booking system, Fixr ensures that users get matched with service providers closest to their location, guaranteeing faster responses and better service quality.

One of Fixrâ€™s standout features is its built-in AI Chatbot, a 24/7 intelligent assistant that helps users throughout the process â€” from guiding them in booking the right service to answering questions and offering real-time support. With real-time professional tracking, users can monitor the location and estimated arrival time of the service providers, adding an extra layer of transparency and trust to every booking. All service providers on Fixr are verified and background-checked to ensure safety, quality, and professionalism for every home service request.

Fixr was developed using cutting-edge technologies like Flutter for cross-platform development, Dart for app programming, and Firebase for real-time data management and authentication. The platformâ€™s secure architecture ensures safe storage of user data and provides multiple secure payment options for a smooth checkout experience. From flexible scheduling to easy management of service histories, Fixr is built to offer users total control and convenience at their fingertips.

The app requires basic permissions like location access to find nearby service providers, storage access for uploading images related to service requests, and phone access to enable direct communication between customers and service providers. All permissions are used strictly for providing a better user experience and ensuring the reliability of services.

Inside the app, users can enjoy a clean, responsive interface with beautiful pages for service browsing, booking, order tracking, and smart chatbot communication. The AI Chatbot ensures that even first-time users can navigate and use the app without confusion, offering instant answers to FAQs, booking support, order updates, and even personalized recommendations.

In the near future, Fixr plans to introduce push notifications for booking updates and special offers, a rating and review system to share experiences, bundled service packages for better deals, and even more advanced AI chatbot capabilities including support for multiple languages and smarter auto-suggestions.

Fixr is available for download on both Android and iOS platforms, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
